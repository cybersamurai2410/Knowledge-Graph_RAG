# Knowledge Graphs with RAG
Automatically build knowledge graphs from text documents with embeddings stored in a graph database for RAG (retrieval augemented generation) with LLMs to retrieve context for question-answering based on the relationships between the data by generating Cypher queries. 

- Use Neo4j query language Cypher to manage and retrieve data stored in knowledge graphs.
- Write knowledge graph queries that find and format text data to provide more relevant context to LLMs for Retrieval Augmented Generation.
- Build a question-answering system using Neo4j and LangChain to chat with a knowledge graph of structured text documents.
